This Online Programming Contest Judge is a highly modular program. It uses the **[Django Web framework](http://djangoproject.com)** for a web frontend.

Colleges (Universities) around the world create and host `Online Programming Contests', in which participants can send the code (in different languages) for a problem hosted, to the server, which in turn evaluates the program and informs the user regarding its validity. The idea of a Judge is not only to verify the code, but also to report the memory usage, execution time, and other such benchmarks.
